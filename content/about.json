  "content": "Hi, I'm Matt — an Electrical Engineer with six years of experience in PCB troubleshooting, manufacturing, and R&D and prototyping experience. My standout achievement: named as an inventor on a U.S. patent application for a Vapor Quality & Vapor Volume Fraction Sensor developed under a Navy Phase II contract (N6833522C0445) at Advanced Cooling Technologies (ACT). I designed and prototyped the custom PCBs that made the sensor possible, supporting next-generation cooling systems for Navy and data center applications.\n\nAt ACT, I also built high-impact hardware for DOE projects, including a vacuum-chamber test system for radiation-shielding CubeSat materials, a plasma power-supply prototype for advanced coatings, and cryogenic/vacuum setups for neutron optics research.\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can take a technical concept from idea to bench-tested prototype, let's connect",
