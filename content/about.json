  "content": "Hi, I'm Matt — an Electrical Engineer with six years of experience in PCB troubleshooting, manufacturing, and R&D and prototyping experience. My standout achievement: named as an inventor on a U.S. patent application for a Vapor Quality & Vapor Volume Fraction Sensor developed under a Navy Phase II contract (N6833522C0445) at Advanced Cooling Technologies (ACT). I designed and prototyped the custom PCBs that made the sensor possible, supporting next-generation cooling systems for Navy and data center applications.\n\nAt ACT, I also engineered:\n\nA vacuum chamber test system to evaluate radiation-shielding polymers for CubeSat electronics (DOE Contract SC0022897)\n\nA prototype plasma power supply used in coating methods for bipolar plates (DOE Contract SC0023833)\n\nCryogenic and vacuum test setups used in advanced neutron optics research (DOE Contract SC0025820)\n\nEarlier in my career at Electronic Manufacturing Services Group (EMSG), I became known for my PCB troubleshooting, quality assurance, and process improvements.\n\nI'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering Technology at Penn State (2023–2027) while continuing to seek out challenging, hands-on roles in research, development, and prototyping.\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can take a technical concept from idea to bench-tested prototype, let's connect.\n",
