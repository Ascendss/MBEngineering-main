  "content": "\nHi, I'm Matt – an Electrical Engineering Technician driven by curiosity, precision, and a love for building smarter systems through real-world experimentation. I bring over six years of hands-on experience in electrical engineering and prototyping, including high-impact contributions to Navy and Department of Energy (DOE) R&D initiatives.\n\nMy proudest achievement to date: being named as an inventor on a U.S. patent application for a Vapor Quality and Vapor Volume Fraction Sensor – developed as part of a Navy Phase II contract (N6833522C0445) while working at Advanced Cooling Technologies (ACT). I led the design and prototyping of custom PCBs that enabled accurate vapor measurements in critical cooling systems, an innovation that directly supported Navy and data center cooling applications.\n\nAt ACT, I also engineered:\n\nA vacuum chamber test system to evaluate radiation-shielding polymers for CubeSat electronics (DOE Contract DE-SC0022897)\n\nA prototype plasma power supply used in coating methods for bipolar plates (DOE Contract DE-SC0023833)\n\nCryogenic and vacuum test setups used in advanced neutron optics research (DOE Contract DE-SC0025820)\n\nEarlier in my career at Electronic Manufacturing Services Group (EMSG), I became known for my PCB troubleshooting, quality assurance, and process improvements—streamlining manufacturing workflows and mentoring junior engineers.\n\nI'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering Technology at Penn State (2023–2027) while continuing to seek out challenging, hands-on roles in research, development, and prototyping.\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can take a technical concept from idea to bench-tested prototype—with precision, grit, and a strong R&D background—let's connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
